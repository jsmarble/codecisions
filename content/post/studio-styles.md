A friend showed me a website today called [studiostyles](http://studiostyles.info/) that is a collection of user-submitted Visual Studio color schemes. The site is nice and simple, and it provides download links for Visual Studio settings files for each Visual Studio version. I went ahead and entered the theme I use plus some modifications. I called it Dark Bliss. Check it out and let me know what you think.
