I accidentally found the handy Visual Studio key combination of Ctrl+I to do an incremental search. It’s a bit odd because you type your search in what appears to be the current cursor location. After you’ve completed typing your search term, press F3 to find the next result. It takes some getting used to, but try it out and you’ll see how it works much easier than trying to understand from what you read. Also, try Ctrl+Shift+I for a reverse search.
