I found a new remote assistance type program called [CrossLoop](http://www.crossloop.com). Itâ€™s basically a [TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com) wrapper that hooks two people up using a unique session id.

The program is free and does not require an account or anything. Just install the application on both sides and share the session id. It connects quickly and seems to work very smoothly.
