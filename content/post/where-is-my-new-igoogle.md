Several months ago I was (randomly) given the new iGoogle homepage before it was released. I liked the changes and got used to the new interface. However, a while back, around the time they released the new iGoogle design publicly, my iGoogle reverted to the old design.

 Now I know a lot of people are saying they don’t like the new design and have good arguments against it, but I liked the new design fine and it’s my nature to want to run the latest and greatest version. So, my question is, how do I get the new iGoogle back? It seems I’m the only one with this “problem”. That, or the few who are like me are keeping quiet in hopes of keeping the old design.

 Some people may be jealous of me having the old design, but I want the new one and can’t figure out how. Any ideas?

 Update: I found my [answer](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-10-17-n21.html). Visit [this page](http://www.google.com/ig/v2invite) to magically get the new iGoogle. (Sorry for those wanting the old one, I don’t have an answer for you.)
