title: Visual Studio Keyboard Shortcut Conflict In Windows 7
---


Many of my codevelopers at work have been using Windows 7 for many months now. Being heavily reliant on keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio, one of the first things I noticed was that the shortcut to remove all breakpoints (Ctrl+Shift+F9) would not work. It turns out that Windows 7 uses that key combination to toggle Windows Aero on and off. This wasnâ€™t immediately apparent to me since at the time my Aero effects were not working, so I saw no effect. Fortunately, a friend had Aero on and later discovered the source of my problem. We solved the issue by changing our shortcut for remove all breakpoints to be simply Ctrl+F9.
