title: Use LINQ In .Net 2.0 Projects
---


Iâ€™ve been really enjoying LINQ lately but am unable to use it at work since we are still in the 2.0 framework for now. I came across a Google Code project that aims to implement LINQ functionality in .Net 2.0 using the same namespaces and methods as .Net 3.5 to make the transition seemless. It also provides the necessary classes to implement extension methods in .Net 2.0.

Note: Visual Studio 2008 is required in order to use this DLL in .Net 2.0.

Before being deployed in a production environment, please verify the functionality and performance of this DLL as the algorithms used are not provided by Microsoft or warranted against defects.
